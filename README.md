# Application_Status_Checker

 CURRENT SCENARIO:-

When there is a Server migration or patching on a prod server,we need to perform smoke testing of all the related applications on all the servers.
To achieve this we have to hit and validate the application on each server manually.This whole process is time taking and chances of error is more as there is manual intervention.

 SOLUTION:-Application Status Checker build on MERN stack.

 EXPECTED BENIFITS:-

1) It will reduce manual efforts/dependency as all the applications status can be displayed at one place automatically.
2) Scripts can be executed in non working hours or after regular interval of time automatically.
3) Anyone can validate the result because of the simple User Interface
